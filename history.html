                <p>The beginning of cyber security can be traced back to the 1970s when a researcher created a virus called creeper that could move through the ARPANET network. In response to this, Ray Tomilson created the first ever antivirus called Reaper, that chased down and deleted creeper.</p>

                <p>In 1987 the commercial antivirus became a thing. This product was made for the Atari ST, this was shortly followed by the ultimate virus killer in 1987. </p>

                  <h3 class="title">1990s</h3>
                  <p>The 1990s saw the internet boom and it became wildly popular as more and more people began starting to use. Unfortunately, people were wildly uneducated about its uses and what it can and cant do, so a lot of people where putting there personal information online 
                    for anyone to find and steal. Organised crime in the 90s saw this as a potential money making scheme and started to siphon as much information about people from the internet as they could. This meant that the cyber security team was left playing catch up in an attempt 
                    to secure theirs and others data.

                <h3 class="title">2000s</h3>
                <p>The 2000s saw rapid development and commercialisation of the internet. As cyber criminals kept attacking others, companies realised the most effective way to make money was to also gain the personal information of its users and sell it to advetisiers. This has not changed since then, and so companies have been investing a large ammount of money 
                  into the most effective way to take this data from its users. There is one upside to this, being that companies have been working hard to ensure that this data stays safe with them as they dont want it being stolen and sold before they can sell it.

                <p>In our current enviroment, privacy is extremely hard to come by with any free companies, however there seem to be hints that this may be changing soon. As the cyber security industry continues to go and more people learn about the importance of privacy and security in an online enviroment, we hope to see a rapid decline
                  in stolen data.
