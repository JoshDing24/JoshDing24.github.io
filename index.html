        <p>Cyber privacy is a crucial part of the internet. It can dictate wether or not other people know personal information about you. Unfortunately your privacy is slowly disapearing as companies such as google and facebook
            become more and more invasive. For instance there is a chance that google has been tracking your location for the last 4 years. Imagine if someone knew everywhere you went for the last 4 years, without your permission.
            This is why I believe that cyber privacy is so important, even when you are doing nothing wrong. Now you might be wondering why companies are taking away our cyber privacy. This is because the more they know about us, the more value we have to advertisers,
            and therefore the more they can sell us for to advertisers. This means we are supposed to give up our own privacy just so that these big companies can sell us as products for more. Without asking our permission first. Now unfortunately this is just going to get harder
            as companies have been getting us to actively upload our own personal information through social media of our own free will. Social media isnt inherintly bad. It is a good way to stay connected. It has just become far too ingrained in our culture, and we have gotten too
            used to putting everything about ourselves on them. For example in the video below, bradley from the youtube channel sumsub (which is a great channel with intresting videos on this and many other topics that i recommend checking out) manages to find out the real identity
            of three people just using a single username.

        <p > However its not all terrible news, as govermants are starting to realise the issues and problems with cyber privacy. There is one major flaw with the way your privacy is treated in the current day and age, and thats the 
            opt-out feature. The way most websites are set up you have to opt-out of tracking, which means all a company has to do is hide this opt-out button deep in some menus and never tell you. This means some govermants are looking 
            into enforcing a opt-in, rather than an opt-out. Until then though, youre privacy is extremely easy to fore-go. This means any site you access can find out what else youve been searching for that day, or any app you download 
            can track your calls or location if you give them permission to without thinking. There are companies out there building profiles of you. What you like and dislike, what you search up, what music you listen to when your sad 
            or the shops you go to when youre happy. Whereas most people take on the philosophy of "Im not doing anything wrong so it doesnt matter", I personally believe everyone should treat their cyber privacy like they are giving all
            of their personal information to a complete stranger, because this is what you are doing.
